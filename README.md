# AI Course Workspace

This workspace is set up for AI/ML development with Python. It includes common libraries and tools needed for machine learning, data analysis, and deep learning.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code files
- `data/` - Dataset storage
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments and tutorials
- `models/` - Saved ML models

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated):

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

2. Launch Jupyter notebooks:

```powershell
jupyter notebook
```

The workspace includes the following key libraries:

- NumPy - For numerical computations
- Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis
- Scikit-learn - For machine learning algorithms
- TensorFlow - For deep learning
- Matplotlib - For data visualization

## Examples

1. Run the Hello World program:

```powershell
python src/hello_world.py
```

2. Run Python Variables Examples:

```powershell
python src/python_variables.py
```

3. Run Practice 1 - Lists and Extractions:

```powershell
python src/practica1.py
```

4. Run Practice 2 - Strings and Lists:

```powershell
python src/practica2.py
```

This will show examples of different Python variable types, lists, and arrays with detailed documentation. And the second practice demonstrates working with strings containing numbers and text, as well as list operations.
