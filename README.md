# AI Course Workspace

This workspace is set up for AI/ML development with Python. It includes common libraries and tools needed for machine learning, data analysis, and deep learning.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code files
- `data/` - Dataset storage
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments and tutorials
- `models/` - Saved ML models

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated):

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

2. Launch Jupyter notebooks:

```powershell
jupyter notebook
```

The workspace includes the following key libraries:

- NumPy - For numerical computations
- Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis
- Scikit-learn - For machine learning algorithms
- TensorFlow - For deep learning
- Matplotlib - For data visualization

## Examples

1. Run the Hello World program:

```powershell
python src/hello_world.py
```

This will display a greeting message in Spanish.
